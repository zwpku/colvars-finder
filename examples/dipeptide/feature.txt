# This file defines features. They will be used in
# (1) defining the preprocessing layer of neural networks; 
# (2) plotting histogram of trajectory data;
# (3) defining a two-dimensional space to plot the learned functions.

# A feature is defined by providing the name, the type of feature, and a selector used in the package MDAnalysis. 
# Supported types are: angle, bond, dihedral, position

[Preprocessing]
#position, type C or type O or type N
